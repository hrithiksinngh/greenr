This is due to the lower emission raw materials used and energy efficient processing conditions.  2. Renewable Content: The bioplastics blend has more than 20-60% renewable content that is either directly derived from plants or is made as byproduct in plant-based products. At this lower price point, ours is a highly renewable material in comparison.  3. Impact on Soil and Earthworms: The plastic is certified compostable in soil with no significant toxicity to plants and earthworms.   4. Compostability: Being Compostable plastic, it not only eliminates toxic and polluting microplastics but also nourishes the soil to improve its quality.

Due to the presence of a high percentage of organic carbon and organic matter, Carbosutra rapidly increases the organic carbon content of the soil, thus enhancing the chemical and physical properties of the soil such as water infiltration ability, moisture holding capacity, nutrient availability, and the biological activity of micro-organisms, thus reducing the risk of erosion and nutrient leaching. \nIt is highly bio-enriched organic liquid manure having much better macronutrients, semi-macronutrients, micronutrients, and microorganisms through simultaneously controlled aerobic and anaerobic treatment. \nThis imparts the plant much faster growth, immunity, and strength at much lower dosage levels. The product is solar sterilized, hence all harmful bacteria and pathogens are eradicated which gives much superior immunity to the plants and enhanced biodiversity to the soil. As a result, it boosts crop yield upto 100% and maximizes yield quality (best-in-class shape, size, colour, texture, taste, nutrition). \nThus it restores damaged soil, preserves biodiversity, drastically decreases non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions happening due to synthetic nitrogenous fertilizers and pesticides, makes regenerative agriculture affordable and scalable, and ensures optimum food security and nutrition, while making agriculture affordable and profitable for farmers.\n\nService: We conduct a 15-day training session (including theoretical and practical training) at the FPO/FPC/local community centers and progressive farmers’ farms to batches of 50 registered farmers orienting them to the importance, and benefits of climate-smart farming, required fertigation and dosages, package of practices, integrated pest management to yield better quality and quantity of production, building significantly higher crop resilience.

These sessions will include regular follow-ups on the package of practices, integrated nutrition management, usage of nano-carbon-based organic fertilizers, integrated pest management during flower and fruit setting and other required climate-smart practices. This will also include conducting monthly in-season Kisan sabha at the lead farmers’ premises in groups of 20-25 farmers to discuss and address ongoing issues of farmers and receive their feedback.

Rural Communities (Farmers):  The reuse of water for agricultural irrigation is often viewed as a positive means of recycling water due to the potentially large volumes of water that can be used. The treated wastewater can have the advantage of being a constant, reliable water source and reduces the amount of water extracted from the environment. Till now, we have designed the systems which is currently treating more than 7 million litres (ML) of water per day and are being reused in a number of our projects. Considering the lifecycle of the project, this would be enough to guarantee the availability of water for 125 million households.  Due to the sequestration potential of CO2, the restoration of waterbody ecosystems falls under the category of solutions that act as carbon sinks (carbon negative). Compared to the business-as-usual scenario, we have saved more than 30,000 tonnes of CO2 using our solution as a service (SaaS).",

          "productOfferings": "We've developed a patented technology-driven recycling process that converts mixed unrecyclable plastics, recycled aggregates (C&D waste) & industrial mineral waste into polymer composite building material. The material is produced as a result of uniform mixing of the main components (filler/aggregate and polymer) at the specified temperature regime, resulting in polymer ingestion of each filler particle. In subsequent moulding and hardening, the aggregate mass polymer forms a homogeneous monolithic structure with high strength. It is far better in performance compared to cement concrete in precast applications such as block, brick & tiles used for pavements, walls & roads. We create plastic circularity by turning low-value packaging waste into high-value composite materials that stay in the economy longer and prevent emissions associated with its disposal, and end-of-life systems. Also offsetting emissions and depletion of resources happening due to manufacturing of traditional building materials such as cement, concrete, etc. We specifically target the low-cost affordable housing & infrastructure segment to alleviate the high construction materials and labour costs with new sustainable building material and factory-made precast products to reduce labour work at the site. Our material has combined properties of plastics & concrete making it an ideal building material.\n\nTECHNOLOGY WISE: We provide an advanced technology-based solution that helps to convert waste liabilities from costing disposal to generating revenue. 1.

          "serviceOfferings": "We've developed a patented technology-driven recycling process that converts mixed unrecyclable plastics, recycled aggregates (C&D waste) & industrial mineral waste into polymer composite building material. The material is produced as a result of uniform mixing of the main components (filler/aggregate and polymer) at the specified temperature regime, resulting in polymer ingestion of each filler particle. In subsequent moulding and hardening, the aggregate mass polymer forms a homogeneous monolithic structure with high strength. It is far better in performance compared to cement concrete in precast applications such as block, brick & tiles used for pavements, walls & roads. We create plastic circularity by turning low-value packaging waste into high-value composite materials that stay in the economy longer and prevent emissions associated with its disposal, and end-of-life systems.

While indigenous people are the knowledge holders and forest keepers, over the years they have been marginalised and their knowledge and resources undervalued. By incentivising the harvest of non-conventional MFPs, we have been able to reinstill value in some forgotten resources alongside asserting notions of conservation. We are asking how food cultures mitigate climate change? The key decision is how much of a resource can be harvested without jeopardising conservation for it to be value-added and marketed. If a certain wild edible is also the food of wildlife, Forest Post discourages harvest for value-addition sake, although we see value in the community itself consuming it as part of a traditional food habit. On the other hand, we encourage harvest of plants that grow in abundance such as stream side ferns and East Indian Arrowroot which is labour intensive to process into flour form. Where possible we have introduced cultivation of plants such as wild ginger, mango ginger, wild grape, wild Asparagus, all of which are chief ingredients in the pickles and candies made by women's groups, and cultivation also of medicinal plants that are used in preparing herbal hair oils.

By removing the need for manual cleaning, our system reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 80% and capital expenditure by 75%. Furthermore, our solution has a significant impact on various beneficiary groups, including aquatic life, local communities, and industries. For instance, aquafarmers will benefit from improved water quality and reduced pollution, leading to increased fish yields and profitability. Municipalities will experience increased recreational opportunities, subsequently boosting tourism and local economies. Also, industries such as food and oil processing will benefit from reduced pollutant inputs and improved effluent quality, ultimately ensuring their operations' sustainability. Our system's ability to minimize environmental harm while promoting sustainable development and public health has far-reaching implications for the overall well-being of the community. ",
